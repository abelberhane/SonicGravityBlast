# Sonic Gravity Blast

A different version/take on an earlier game I developed in my portfolio with a Sonic theme. I am still having a recurring issue about using
Gif's that may be moving too fast and causing the Image to shake a lot. This has been an issue that I have been working on in my games. 

I am actively looking for a solution to this bug. The game has a restart button that you can utilize to play again once you finish. There
are sections in my code that I have notated where you can change them to increase the difficulty. Have fun!
